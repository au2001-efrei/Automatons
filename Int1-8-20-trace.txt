Alphabet: a b c d
Initial states: 0 1 6 7 8
Terminal states: 5
Transition table:
  /  | a | b | c | d 
-----+---+---+---+---
 → 0 |   |   |   | 5 
 → 1 | 2 |   |   |

2. Determinizing and completing automaton...
This automaton is already synchronous.
This automaton is not deterministic because it has 5 initial states (more than one).
This automaton is already synchronous.
This automaton is incomplete because it misses 13 transition(s).
Alphabet: a b c d
Initial states: 0,1,6,7,8
Terminal states: 5
Transition table:
      /      | a | b | c | d 
-------------+---+---+---+---
 → 0,1,6,7,8 | 2 | 3 | 4 | 5

3. Minimizing automaton...
Current partition: {'5'} {'2', '0,1,6,7,8', '3', 'X', '4'}
Current partition: {'5'} {'2', 'X', '3'} {'4', '0,1,6,7,8'}
Current partition: {'5'} {'3'} {'X', '2'} {'0,1,6,7,8'} {'4'}
Current partition: {'5'} {'3'} {'X'} {'2'} {'0,1,6,7,8'} {'4'}
This automaton is already minimized.

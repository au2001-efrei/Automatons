1. Reading automaton...
Alphabet: a b c d
Initial states: 1
Terminal states: 1
Transition table:
  /   | a | b | c | d 
------+---+---+---+---
  0   |   |   |   | 1 
 ←→ 1 | 2 |   |   |   
  2   |   | 3 |   |   
  3   |   |   | 0 |   

2. Determinizing and completing automaton...
This automaton is already synchronous.
This automaton is already deterministic.
This automaton is already synchronous.
This automaton is incomplete because it misses 12 transition(s).
Alphabet: a b c d
Initial states: 1
Terminal states: 1
Transition table:
  /   | a | b | c | d 
------+---+---+---+---
  0   | X | X | X | 1 
 ←→ 1 | 2 | X | X | X 
  2   | X | 3 | X | X 
  3   | X | X | 0 | X 
  X   | X | X | X | X 

3. Minimizing automaton...
Current partition: {'0', '2', '3', 'X'} {'1'}
Current partition: {'0'} {'1'} {'2', '3', 'X'}
Current partition: {'0'} {'1'} {'2', 'X'} {'3'}
Current partition: {'0'} {'1'} {'2'} {'3'} {'X'}
This automaton is already minimized.
Alphabet: a b c d
Initial states: 1
Terminal states: 1
Transition table:
  /   | a | b | c | d 
------+---+---+---+---
  0   | X | X | X | 1 
 ←→ 1 | 2 | X | X | X 
  2   | X | 3 | X | X 
  3   | X | X | 0 | X

7. Standardizing automaton...
This automaton is not standard because it has at least one transition with destination the initial state (0d1).
Alphabet: a b c d
Initial states: I
Terminal states: 0 2 3 X
Transition table:
  /  | a | b | c | d 
-----+---+---+---+---
 ← 0 | X | X | X | 1

 ← 2 | X | 3 | X | X 
 ← 3 | X | X | 0 | X 
 → I | 2 | X | X | X 
 ← X | X | X | X | X

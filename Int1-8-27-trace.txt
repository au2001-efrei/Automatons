1. Reading automaton...
Alphabet: a b
Initial states: 1
Terminal states: 0
Transition table:
  /  | a | b 
-----+---+---
 ← 0 | 0 | 0 
 → 1 | 2 | 2 
  2  |   | 0 

2. Determinizing and completing automaton...
This automaton is already synchronous.
This automaton is already deterministic.
This automaton is already synchronous.
This automaton is incomplete because it misses 1 transition(s).
Alphabet: a b
Initial states: 1
Terminal states: 0
Transition table:
  /  | a | b 
-----+---+---
 ← 0 | 0 | 0 
 → 1 | 2 | 2 
  2  | X | 0 
  X  | X | X 

3. Minimizing automaton...
Current partition: {'0'} {'X', '2', '1'}
Current partition: {'0'} {'2'} {'X', '1'}
Current partition: {'0'} {'2'} {'X'} {'1'}
This automaton is already minimized.
Alphabet: a b
Initial states: 1
Terminal states: 0
Transition table:
  /  | a | b 
-----+---+---
 ← 0 | 0 | 0 
 → 1 | 2 | 2 
  2  | X | 0 
  X  | X | X

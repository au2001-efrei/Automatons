1. Reading automaton...
Alphabet: a
Initial states: 0
Terminal states:
Transition table:
  /  | a 
-----+---
 → 0 | 1 
  1  |   

2. Determinizing and completing automaton...
Alphabet: a
Initial states: 0
Terminal states:
Transition table:
  /  | a 
-----+---
 → 0 | 1 
  1  | X 
  X  | X 

3. Minimizing automaton...
Alphabet: a
Initial states: 0+1+X
Terminal states:
Transition table:
    /    |   a   
---------+-------
 → 0+1+X | 0+1+X 

4. Starting word recognition...
This step was skipped in this output file.
Execute the program to test word recognition by yourself.

5. Creating an automaton which recognizes the complementary language...
Alphabet: a
Initial states: 0+1+X
Terminal states: 0+1+X
Transition table:
    /     |   a   
----------+-------
 ←→ 0+1+X | 0+1+X

7. Standardizing automaton...
Alphabet: a
Initial states: I
Terminal states: 0+1+X
Transition table:
    /    |   a   
---------+-------
 ← 0+1+X | 0+1+X 
   → I   | 0+1+X

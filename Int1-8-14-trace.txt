1. Reading automaton...
Alphabet: a b c d
Initial states: 0
Terminal states: 1
Transition table:
  /  | a | b | c | d 
-----+---+---+---+---
 → 0 | 0 | 2 | 3 | 1 
 ← 1 |   |   |   | 1 
  2  |   | 2 | 3 | 1 
  3  |   |   | 3 | 1 

2. Determinizing and completing automaton...
This automaton is already synchronous.
This automaton is already deterministic.
This automaton is already synchronous.
This automaton is incomplete because it misses 6 transition(s).
Alphabet: a b c d
Initial states: 0
Terminal states: 1
Transition table:
  /  | a | b | c | d 
-----+---+---+---+---
 → 0 | 0 | 2 | 3 | 1 
 ← 1 | X | X | X | 1 
  2  | X | 2 | 3 | 1 
  3  | X | X | 3 | 1 
  X  | X | X | X | X 

3. Minimizing automaton...
Current partition: {'1'} {'X', '3', '2', '0'}
Current partition: {'1'} {'X'} {'3', '2', '0'}
Current partition: {'1'} {'X'} {'2'} {'3'} {'0'}
This automaton is already minimized.
Alphabet: a b c d
Initial states: 0
Terminal states: 1
Transition table:
  /  | a | b | c | d 
-----+---+---+---+---
 → 0 | 0 | 2 | 3 | 1 
 ← 1 | X | X | X | 1 
  2  | X | 2 | 3 | 1 
  3  | X | X | 3 | 1

7. Standardizing automaton...
This automaton is not standard because it has at least one transition with destination the initial state (0a0).

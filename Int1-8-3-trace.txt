1. Reading automaton...
Alphabet: a
Initial states: 0
Terminal states: 1
Transition table:
  /  | a 
-----+---
 → 0 | 1 
 ← 1 |   

2. Determinizing and completing automaton...
This automaton is already synchronous.
This automaton is already deterministic.
This automaton is already synchronous.
This automaton is incomplete because it misses 1 transition(s).
Alphabet: a
Initial states: 0
Terminal states: 1
Transition table:
  /  | a 
-----+---
 → 0 | 1 
 ← 1 | X 
  X  | X 

3. Minimizing automaton...
Current partition: {'1'} {'X', '0'}
Current partition: {'1'} {'0'} {'X'}
This automaton is already minimized.
Alphabet: a
Initial states: 0
Terminal states: 1

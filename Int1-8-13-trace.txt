1. Reading automaton...
Alphabet: a
Initial states: 1
Terminal states: 0 3 4 5 6 7
Transition table:
  /  | a 
-----+---
 ← 0 | 0 
 → 1 | 2 
  2  | 3 
 ← 3 | 4 
 ← 4 | 5 
 ← 5 | 6 
 ← 6 | 7 
 ← 7 | 0 

2. Determinizing and completing automaton...
This automaton is already synchronous.
This automaton is already deterministic.
This automaton is already synchronous.
This automaton is already complete.

3. Minimizing automaton...
Current partition: {'0', '3', '7', '4', '6', '5'} {'2', '1'}
Current partition: {'0', '3', '7', '4', '6', '5'} {'2'} {'1'}
Alphabet: a
Initial states: 1
Terminal states: 0+3+4+5+6+7
Transition table:
       /       |      a      
---------------+-------------
 ← 0+3+4+5+6+7 | 0+3+4+5+6+7 
      → 1      |      2

4. Starting word recognition...
This step was skipped in this output file.
Execute the program to test word recognition by yourself.

5. Creating an automaton which recognizes the complementary language...
This automaton is already synchronous.
This automaton is not deterministic because it has several transitions with the same origin (0+3+4+5+6+7) and letter (a).
This automaton is already synchronous.
This automaton is already complete.
Alphabet: a

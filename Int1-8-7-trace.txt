1. Reading automaton...
Alphabet: a
Initial states: 1
Terminal states: 0
Transition table:
  /  |  a  
-----+-----
 ← 0 |     
 → 1 | 0 1 

2. Determinizing and completing automaton...
This automaton is already synchronous.
This automaton is not deterministic because it has several transitions with the same origin (1) and letter (a).
This automaton is already synchronous.
This automaton is already complete.
Alphabet: a
Initial states: 1
Terminal states: 0,1
Transition table:
   /   |  a  
-------+-----
 ← 0,1 | 0,1 
  → 1  | 0,1 

3. Minimizing automaton...
Current partition: {'0,1'} {'1'}
This automaton is already minimized.
Alphabet: a
Initial states: 1
Terminal states: 0,1
Transition table:
   /   |  a  
-------+-----
 ← 0,1 | 0,1 
  → 1  | 0,1 

4. Starting word recognition...

1. Reading automaton...
Alphabet: a
Initial states: 0
Terminal states:
Transition table:
  /  | a 
-----+---
 → 0 | 1 
  1  |   

2. Determinizing and completing automaton...
Alphabet: a
Initial states: 0
Terminal states:
Transition table:
  /  | a 
-----+---
 → 0 | 1 
  1  | X 
  X  | X 

3. Minimizing automaton...
Alphabet: a
Initial states:
Terminal states:
Transition table:
   /   |   a   
-------+-------
 0+1+X | 0+1+X
